# Recommendation Engine 
For Personalized And New Users.

# ncf_and_content_based
1.) Personalized For Pre-Existing Users With Post Behaviour And History.
2.) Run- model_test.py.
3.) Note: Before preprocessing, I have extracted titles from the Title field and descriptions from the Category from the original dataset Field Because I only need this. for eg id, category, slug, title, identifier, comment_count, upvote_count, view_count, exit_count, rating_count, average_rating, share_count, video_link, contract_address, chain_id, chart_url, base_token, is_locked, created_at, first_name, last_name, username, upvoted, bookmarked,thumbnail_url, following,picture_url these all are header fields I only need title field values and description which is under the sub-category of the category header field.
For this, I did feature engineering.

# new_users_recommendation
1.) For New Users WitHout Any History.
2.) Run- model_recommendation.py.
3.) Note: Same for this also extracting only useful fields, doing feature engineering.
